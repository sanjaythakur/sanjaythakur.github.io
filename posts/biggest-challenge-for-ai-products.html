Title: AI products are fundamentally harder than non-AI products

Let me say this, AI startups are fundamentally harder than a similar startup without AI. And I say this I don't mean demos or vibe coded applications. They by impressive but when it comes to building a product that is used by millions of people, it is a different ball game.

Make no mistake, the opportunity size is huge and with the direction we collectively have taken by funding and being involved it is inevitable that it would completely transform the way we operate. But no mistake it is not easy.

That is still the tip of the iceberg. Other second order challenges emanate from lacvk of system design principles like data privacy, security, reliability, scalability, etc.

My observations have been people underestimating how difficult it is to make AI behave in reasonably predictable and high-quality ways.

Conclusion: AI products are fundamentally harder than non-AI products
