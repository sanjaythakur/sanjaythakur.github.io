                <h1>My 30-Day Digital Detox Experience</h1>
                <p class="post-date">July 25, 2023</p>
                
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>For the past month, I embarked on a challenging experiment: significantly reducing my screen time and digital consumption. The results were more profound than I expected.</p>
                    
                    <p>In our hyperconnected world, we rarely give ourselves permission to disconnect. This experiment began as a way to reclaim my attention and ended up transforming my relationship with technology altogether.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Rules I Set</h2>
                    <p>My digital detox wasn't about eliminating technology completely, but rather establishing healthier boundaries:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No screens within the first hour of waking or the last hour before sleep</li>
                        <li>Social media limited to 15 minutes per day</li>
                        <li>Email checked only twice daily at scheduled times</li>
                        <li>One full day per week completely screen-free</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Unexpected Benefits</h2>
                    <p>While I anticipated improved focus, I was surprised by several other positive outcomes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Better sleep quality</strong> - My sleep tracker showed a 27% improvement in deep sleep</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced anxiety</strong> - Without the constant stream of news and notifications, my baseline stress levels decreased</li>
                        <li><strong>More meaningful connections</strong> - I found myself having deeper conversations and being more present with friends</li>
                        <li><strong>Rediscovery of old hobbies</strong> - I finally returned to sketching and reading physical books</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, this experiment helped me recognize how much of my digital consumption was habitual rather than intentional. Going forward, I'm adopting a more mindful approach to technology, using it as a tool rather than allowing it to use me.</p>
