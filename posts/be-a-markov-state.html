                <h1>Markov State and the Art of Living</h1>
                <p class="post-date">May 7, 2025</p>
                
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>
                        Nearly a decade ago, I found myself immersed in David Silver's deep reinforcement learning lectures on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (hard to believe how quickly time passes). Among the many technical concepts, one phrase stood out and quietly etched itself into my memory: <strong>Markov State</strong>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="markov-definition">
                        Its simple yet profound definition struck a chord: <strong>the future depends only on the present state and not on the past</strong>. That moment felt magical. My eyes lit up. Something about it resonated deeply with my lived experience.
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        As I reflected, my mind wandered through old memories - both triumphs and failures. A common thread ran through them: I was often either stuck in regret or resting in complacency, fixated too much on the past. That fixation had, at times, paralyzed me. The Markov property offered a liberating counterpoint: the present moment alone shapes the probabilities of the future.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This insight reminded me of another moment that left a lasting impression - watching a film in which a line from the <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong> was quoted:
                    </p>

                    <div class="sanskrit-verse">
                        <div class="sanskrit-text">
                            यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ |<br>
                            समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते || 2.15 ||
                        </div>
                        <div class="sanskrit-translation">
                            "O Arjun, noblest among men, that person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and remains steady in both becomes eligible for liberation."
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p> 
                        Though spoken in a vastly different context, the verse touched me in a similar way. It spoke of equanimity - of staying centered regardless of life's emotional swings. To me, this echoed the essence of the Markov State: anchoring yourself in the present, unmoved by the turbulence of the past.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And so, here I am today, striving - in the deepest sense - to <strong>be</strong> a Markov State. To focus on doing the next right thing for my family, my country, and the world. To contribute, in whatever small way I can, toward leaving the world better than I found it.
                    </p>

                    <div class="markov-definition">
                        "The future is conditionally independent of the past given the present." That's the technical articulation of the Markov property. But looked at through a human lens, it becomes something powerful.
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        It reminds us that no matter the baggage we carry - regrets, achievements, mistakes - it is our present choices that shape the possibilities ahead.
                        
                        Of course, life isn't a perfect Markov process. Our "states" are often colored by complex histories. But as a <strong>mental model</strong>, it's empowering. It shifts our focus from helplessness to agency, from nostalgia or guilt to responsibility.
                        
                        It reminds us: we are not prisoners of our past, but stewards of our future - through the actions we choose in this very moment.
                    </p>
