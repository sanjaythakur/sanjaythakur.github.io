                        <p class="bio-intro">Hi again! I'm Sanjay, a technologist passionate about making education accessible globally through AI. After my journey with Markovian AI (acquired in 2023) and leading engineering at Curium in Singapore, I'm now fully focused on Widushi.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        My mission at <strong>Widushi</strong> is reimagining how students learn through personalized AI tutoring. Our mission is to democratize high-quality education, making personalized learning accessible to students regardless of geographic or economic barriers.

                            <ul class="bio-list">
                                <li>I built and sold <strong>Markovian AI</strong> which was a data-search engine in Toronto. Think of it as a Google-for-enterprises before things like RAG, LLM was a cool thing.</li>
                                <li>I gained the dark knowledge of controlling ML behavior at the best ML research institute in the world â€“ <strong>Mila</strong> and published at top-tier conferences. See my <a href="#">Google Scholar page</a> here.</li>
                                <li>At the age of 19 years, I built and patented an app that was purchased by the <strong>Indian Railways</strong>. I owe it to Zine which facilitated this opportunity when I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree.</li>
                                <li>During my third year of undergraduate, I built a <strong>Smartmeter</strong> for home automation, power saving and power grid balance. It was patented and awarded the runner-up prize at GridTech'15 International Conference & Exhibition.</li>
                                <li>I have been part of the only team that has won the most popular sports tournament of my university called <strong>Hong Kong Sixes</strong> twice in the 80+ years of university history.</li>

                            <h4 class="section-title">Growing Up & Inspirations</h4>
                            <p>I was born in Guwahati, Assam, a north-eastern state of India. However, I was raised in six different cities which are Guwahati, Trivandrum, Ranchi, Hyderabad, Neemuch, and Jaipur.</p>
                            <p>I am a big admirer of Aaron Swartz and Elon Musk and I deeply admire their work. I am even a bigger fan of Virat Kohli. I would be very happy if I can be even a fraction passionate, hard-working, go-getter, and mentally strong as he is.</p>
                            <p>There are many other personalities too who I always look up to. Some of them are Narendra Modi, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, and MS Dhoni.</p>

                            <p>I am also a movieholic, and my favorite movie so far has been Lakshya. For some mysterious reason, I can't get enough of the Bhavesh Joshi movie either.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes you would also find me immersed into a book. I find them a great way to stimulate my mind. A couple of awesome books that I recently read and found useful are:</p>
                            <ul class="bio-list">
                                <li><em>A Skeptics' Guide to the Universe</em></li>
                                <li><em>Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed</em></li>
